ColdMVC leverages custom annotations on your components to provide additional functionality throughout your application.

The custom metadata can be parsed by other components within the framework to customize your application without having to rely on external configuration files.

Annotations can be used for a variety of settings, such as specifying the views and layouts associated with actions on your controllers, as well as specifying the allowed return formats for your requests.

For a complete list of the annotations used by the framework, you can visit the reference manual for [annotations] [1].
