Since ColdMVC is a convention-based framework, it's important that applications follow a similar directory structure in order to take advantage of the framework's conventions. A typical ColdMVC directory structure looks like the following:

	root/
		app/
			controllers/
				LayoutController.cfc
			layouts/
				index.cfm
			model/
			views/
		config/
			coldspring.xml
			config.ini
			environment.txt
			hibernate.hbmxml
			plugins.cfm
			routes.cfm
		public/
			css/
			images/
			js/
			index.cfm
		Application.cfc

Here's a brief description of the various files and folders.
