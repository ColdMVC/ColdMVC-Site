In the following example, the _paperback_ action in the _BookController_ will render the view located at _/views/book/list.cfm_ rather than the default location of _/views/book/paperback.cfm_

**BookController.cfc**

	/**
 	 * @accessors true
	 * @singleton
	 */
	component {

		property _Book;
		
		/**
 		 * @view book/list.cfm
		 * /
		function paperback() {

			params.books = _Book.findAllByType("Paperback");

		}

	}
