By default, a controller's views are located inside a directory with the same name as the controller. For example, a _FooController_ would normally have its views located inside _/views/foo/_. You can change the location for a controller's views by using the _@directory_ annotation.  

In the following example, requests made to the _BookController_ will render views located inside _/views/admin/books/_, rather than the default _/views/book/_ location.

**BookController.cfc**

	/**
 	 * @accessors true
 	 * @directory admin/books
	 * @singleton
	 */
	component {

		property _Book;
	
		function list() {
			
			// this will render /views/admin/books/list.cfm
			params.books = _Book.list();
	
		}

	}
