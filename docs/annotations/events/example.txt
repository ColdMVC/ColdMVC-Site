You can add event listeners to functions by using the _@events_ annotation. The value of the annotation can be a regular expression that matches any of the various events that are triggered during the life of a request.

In the following example, the _SecurityController_ will listen for an _unauthorizedRequest_ event and redirect the user accordingly. 

**SecurityController.cfc**

	/**
 	 * @accessors true
	 * @singleton
	 */
	component {

		/**
		 * @events unauthorizedRequest
		 */
		function redirectUser() {

			flash.message = "You must be logged in to see that page";

			redirect({controller="login", action="index"});

		}

	}
