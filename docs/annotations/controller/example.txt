Controllers are referenced in the framework by their name, which is typically an underscore-ized name of the component without the _Controller_ suffix. For example, _FooController.cfc_ would be referenced as the _foo_ controller, while _FooBarController.cfc_ would be referenced as the _foo_bar_ controller. While this convention works in most cases, you can use _@controller_ to change the name of a controller.

In the following example, the _BookController_ is aliased as _mybook_, so that requests made to _/mybook/list_ will execute _BookController.list()_.

**BookController.cfc**

	/**
 	 * @accessors true
 	 * @controller mybook
	 * @singleton
	 */
	component {

		property _Book;
		
		function list() {
		
			params.books = _Book.list();
		
		}
		
		function save() {

			var book = _Book.get(params.id);
			populate(params.book);
			book.save();
			
			flash.message = "Book saved successfully";

			redirect({controller="mybook", action="list"});
	
		}

	}
