The title tag can be used to set request-specific title tags.

Since views are executed before layouts, you can set title tag within the view using &lt;c:title value="My Title" /&gt;. 

Internally this stores the title as an array of strings that can the be displayed within the layout using &lt;c:title /&gt;, which wraps the title inside &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;.
