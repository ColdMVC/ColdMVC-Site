The title tag can be used to set request-specific title tags.

Since views are executed before layouts, you can set title tag within the view using _&lt;cfset setTitle("My Title"); /&gt;_. 

The title can then be displayed on the layout using &lt;c:title /&gt;, which wraps the title inside &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;.
