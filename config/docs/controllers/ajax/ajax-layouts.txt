There is not a layout associated with Ajax requests by default.
This is because most of the time your Ajax requests will return a small snippet of HTML, or possiblly a JSON or XML string.
If you would like to wrap your Ajax views inside a layout during Ajax requests, you would add an _@ajaxLayout_ annotation to your controller's actions.

	/**
	 * @ajaxLayout modal
	 * /
	function search() {

		params.results = _Book.findAllByTitleLike(params.q);

	}
	
You will also need to allow your action to respond to the format by adding a _@formats_ annotation to the action on your controller.
By default, all actions only respond to a _html_ and _pdf_ formats.

	/**
	 * @formats json
	 * /
	function results() {

		params.results = _Book.findAllByTitleLike(params.q);

	}
