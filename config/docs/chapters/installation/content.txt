After you've [downloaded ColdMVC] [1], there are three simple ways you can install the framework.

1. Create a _/coldmvc_ mapping inside ColdFusion Administrator that points to the framework.
2. Put the framework directly inside your server's web root.
3. Put the framework directly inside your application's root.

Pretty simple, right?
