Controllers are responding for handling requests, fetching data from the model, and optionally rendering views.

Controllers are located inside your application's _/app/controllers/_ directory.

In order for a component to be considered a controller, it must be registered with the bean factory as a singleton using the [_@singleton_] [1] annotation and the file must be named using a "Controller" suffix. For example, a user controller would be located at _/app/controllers/UserController.cfc_.

All public methods on a controller are considered actions.
