Since ColdMVC is a convention-based framework, it's important that applications follow a similar directory structure in order to take advantage of the framework's conventions. A typical ColdMVC directory structure looks like the following:

	app/
		controllers/
			LayoutController.cfc
		layouts/
			index.cfm
		model/
		views/
	config/
		coldspring.xml
		config.ini
		environment.txt
		hibernate.hbmxml
		plugins.cfm
		routes.cfm
	public/
		css/
		images/
		js/
		index.cfm
	Application.cfc

Here's a brief description of the various files and folders.
