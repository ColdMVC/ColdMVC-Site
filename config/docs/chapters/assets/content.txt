ColdMVC provides an easy way to work with your application's public assets, including images, CSS files, and JavaScript files.

## Images

Images will be located inside your application's _/root/public/images/_ directory.

There are a few ways to render images. The easiest way is to use the _image_ tag: 

	<c:image name="logo.gif" />

Another method is to use the _renderImage_ view helper:

	#renderImage("logo.gif")#

Finally, you can also use the _linkToImage_ view helper to display just the URL to the image.

	<img src="#linkToImage("logo.gif")# alt="" />

The previous three examples all output equivalent HTML.

## CSS Files

Cascading stylesheets, or CSS files, will be located inside your application's _/root/public/css/_ directory.

There are a few ways to render links to CSS files. The easiest way is to use the _style_ tag: 

	<c:style name="style.css" />

Another method is to use the _renderCSS_ view helper:

	#renderCSS("style.css")#

Finally, you can also use the _linkToCSS_ view helper to display just the URL to the CSS file.

	<link href="#linkToCSS("style.css")#" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />

The previous three examples all output equivalent HTML.

## JavaScript Files

JavaScript files will be located inside your application's _/root/public/js/_ directory.

There are a few ways to render links to JavaScript files. The easiest way is to use the _script_ tag: 

	<c:script name="jquery.js" />

Another method is to use the _renderJS_ view helper:

	#renderJS("jquery.js")#

Finally, you can also use the _linkToJS_ view helper to display just the URL to the JavaScript file.

	<script src="#linkToJS("jquery.js")#" type="text/javascript"></script>

The previous three examples all output equivalent HTML.
