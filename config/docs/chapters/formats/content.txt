Requests can respond to different request formats, including _html_, _json_, _xml_, and _pdf_.

By default, all requests can respond to _html_ and _pdf_ formats.
You can allow for more formats by using the _@formats_ annotation.
Possible values include _html_, _pdf_, _json_, and _xml_.

By default, all requests are rendered using an _html_ format.

You can render a request in a different format by either specifying a _format_ parameter in the URL (_http://myapp.com/product/show/1?format=pdf_) or by adding a format extension in the URL (_http://myapp.com/product/show/1.pdf_).

For more information, see the [formats] [1] annotation.
