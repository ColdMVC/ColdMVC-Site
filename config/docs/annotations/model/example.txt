In the following example, the model for the _BookController_ will be set to _FictionalBook_, allowing the inherited methods inside _coldmvc.Controller_ to use the _FictionalBook_ model rather than the default _Book_ model.

**BookController.cfc**

	/**
 	 * @accessors true
	 * @extends coldmvc.Controller
 	 * @model FictionalBook
	 */
	component {

	}
