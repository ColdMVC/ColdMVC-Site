By default, all actions can be rendered in either _html_ or _pdf_ format, but you can allow for more formats by using the _@formats_ annotation.
Possible values include _html_, _pdf_, _json_, and _xml_.

The _@formats_ annotation value accepts a comma-separated list of formats.

If the current format is not allowed for the current action, a 403 exception is thrown.

For more information, see the [chapter on formats] [1] in the [reference guide] [2].
