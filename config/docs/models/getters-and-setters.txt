You can access your model's properties several ways.

Option 1: You can use ColdFusion's built-in getters and setters for persistent properties.

	var book = _Book.new();
	
	book.setTitle("The Da Vinci Code"); // setter
	
	var title = book.getTitle(); // getter
	
Option 2: You can use your model's _prop_ method.

	var book = _Book.new();
	
	book.prop("title", "The Da Vinci Code"); // setter
	
	var title = book.prop("title"); // getter
	
Option 3: You can access each property as a method via _onMissingMethod()_.

	var book = _Book.new();
	
	book.title("The Da Vinci Code"); // setter
	
	var title = book.title(); // getter
	
It can be easier to use either option 2 or 3 when working with relationships as ColdMVC will automatically cast empty values to _NULL_ and handle building relationships for you.

For example, if each _Book_ had a relationship to an _Author_, here is how you would update a _Book_ with an ID of 2 to have an _Author_ with an ID of 5 for each of the options listed above.

Option 1:

	var book = _Book.get(2);
	
	var author = _Author.get(5);
	
	book.setAuthor(author);
	
Option 2:
	
	var book = _Book.get(2);
	
	book.prop("author", 5);
	
Option 3:

	var book = _Book.get(2);
	
	book.author(5);
	
As you can see, options 2 and 3 are considerably shorter than option 1.
