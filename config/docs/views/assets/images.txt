Images will be located inside your application's _/public/images/_ directory.

There are a few ways to render images. The easiest way is to use the _image_ tag: 

	<c:image name="logo.gif" />

Another method is to use the _renderImage_ view helper:

	#renderImage("logo.gif")#

Finally, you can also use the _linkToImage_ view helper to display just the URL to the image.

	<img src="#linkToImage("logo.gif")# alt="" />

The previous three examples all output equivalent HTML.
