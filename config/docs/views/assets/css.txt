Cascading stylesheets, or CSS files, will be located inside your application's _/public/css/_ directory.

There are a few ways to render links to CSS files. The easiest way is to use the _style_ tag: 

	<c:style name="style.css" />

Another method is to use the _renderCSS_ view helper:

	#renderCSS("style.css")#

Finally, you can also use the _linkToCSS_ view helper to display just the URL to the CSS file.

	<link href="#linkToCSS("style.css")#" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />

The previous three examples all output equivalent HTML.
