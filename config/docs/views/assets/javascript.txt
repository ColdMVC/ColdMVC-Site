JavaScript files will be located inside your application's _/public/js/_ directory.

There are a few ways to render links to JavaScript files. The easiest way is to use the _script_ tag: 

	<c:script name="jquery.js" />

Another method is to use the _renderJS_ view helper:

	#renderJS("jquery.js")#

Finally, you can also use the _linkToJS_ view helper to display just the URL to the JavaScript file.

	<script src="#linkToJS("jquery.js")#" type="text/javascript"></script>

The previous three examples all output equivalent HTML.
