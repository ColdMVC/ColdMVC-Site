ColdMVC allows you to create helper components that are available to your entire application. These helper components are good for containing useful methods similar to those found on cflib.org.

When ColdMVC first loads, it will load any helpers located within your application's _/app/helpers/_ folder, then any helpers inside _/coldmvc/app/helpers/_ folder that haven't been loaded yet. These helpers will then be available throughout your application inside the _$_ and _coldmvc_ variables.

ColdMVC ships with a handful of helpers that can be found inside _/coldmvc/app/helpers/_. If you would like to override the functionality of one of ColdMVC's helpers, simply create a _.cfc_ with the same name inside your application's _/app/helpers/_ directory, extend the corresponding ColdMVC helper, and make your changes.

You can create your own helpers by creating a _.cfc_ and placing it inside your application's _/app/helpers/_ folder. For example, if you created a file located at _/app/helpers/tony.cfc_, you would then have access to that helper throughout your application by using _$.tony_ or _coldmvc.tony_.
