You can pass complex values into your beans by using [JSON] [2] syntax for the value of your config setting. The bean factory will automatically convert the JSON string into a complex object before injecting 

the property into the component. The following example will inject an array into the _setBar_ method on the _fooService_ singleton bean.

	fooService.bar=["boo", "baz"]
