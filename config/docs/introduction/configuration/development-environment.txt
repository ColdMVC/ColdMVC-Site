By setting _development_ to _true_, we enable a couple convenience options in our application for working in development mode. First, your application's views, layouts, and tags are re-generated each 

request, allowing you to see your changes immediately. Second, various internal component caches are cleared each request, such as caches for custom event listeners. Finally, debug information will be append 

to the bottom of your view, providing you with access to key information for your request.

Next, we set a _autoReload_ setting to _true_, meaning the application will be automatically reloaded each request. This is very helpful when in development in order to automatically reload your singleton 

components.
