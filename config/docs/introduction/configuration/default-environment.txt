Inside the _default_ environment, we define the name of our application's default controller. In this case, we've set the value to _blog_. If we were to make a request to our application without specifying a 

controller, our application will route the request to the _BlogController_ by default.

We also set a _sesURLs_ property to true. This tells our application not to include _index.cfm_ on any URLs generated by the _linkTo_ or _redirect_ methods. Note: if you enable the _sesURLs_ config setting, 

it is up to you to provide the necessary URL rewriting logic inside an _.htaccess_ file or _web.config_ file, depending on which web server you're using.
