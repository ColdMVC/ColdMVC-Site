ColdMVC follows the [Model-View-Controller (MVC)] [1] design pattern.
In this type of application, incoming requests are handled by a controller, which retrieves data from the model, and optionally renders a view.

If you're looking for a better description of MVC, [there are plenty of online articles written on the topic] [2].
