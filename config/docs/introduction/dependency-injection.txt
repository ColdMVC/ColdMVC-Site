You can very easily create singleton components and inject them into other components without much hassle.

To create a singleton component, simply add an _@singleton_ annotation to the component.

When ColdMVC first loads, it will scan your application and any registered plugins to find components that have been marked as singletons.

ColdMVC will then add the components to its bean factory, which then manages the dependencies between the objects.

If you want more a granular level of control over dependency injection, you can create a configuration file located at _/config/beans.xml_ and ColdMVC will use the bean definitions within the configuration file to manage your dependencies.
