### About Plugins

Plugins are a great way of extending the functionality of the framework without modifying the core files.

For more information on plugins, check out the [chapter on plugins] [1] in the [Reference Guide] [2].

If you have a plugin that you'd like to share, let us know by sending an email to <coldmvc@gmail.com>.
