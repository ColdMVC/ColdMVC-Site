### About Tags

Tags provide a clean way of encapsulating reusable presentation code.

For more information on tags, check out the chapter on tags in the [Reference Guide] [1].

If you have a tag that you think should be included in the core framework, let us know by sending an email to <coldmvc@gmail.com>.
