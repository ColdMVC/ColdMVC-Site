Dynamically invoke your ColdMVC application's custom tags.

* Usage
	
	html = tagInvoker.invoke(tag, attributes);

* Installation

Download the TagInvoker plugin for ColdMVC and put it inside your _/plugins_ folder.

Update your app's _/config/plugins.cfm_ with the following.

	<cfset add("taginvoker") />

* Example

	/**
	 * @accessors true
	 * @singleton
	 */
	component {
	
		property tagInvoker;
	
		function index() {
	
			var html = tagInvoker.invoke("input", {
				name = "firstName",
				value = "Tony"
			});
			
			writeDump(html);
			abort;
	
		}
	
	}

* Notes

The TagInvoker works by getting the registered custom tags from ColdMVC and generating a temporary ColdFusion template with a switch statement for each custom tag.

The temporary template is written to /generated/taginvoker/tags.cfm when the application is first loaded.

* Disclosure

I'm not sure how if this is actually useful, but it might be if you're creating some sort of form builder.
